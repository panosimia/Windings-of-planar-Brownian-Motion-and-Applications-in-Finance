## Abstract
This thesis delves into the study of ”Windings of Planar Brownian Motion and its Applications in Finance”, 
exploring the fascinating world of stochastic analysis in economics. Beginning with an insightful historical review of Brownian motion, we establish essential notations and penetrate the main properties of one-dimensional Brownian motion, including the Strong
Markov Property, the Reflection Principle and the Martingale property. Furthermore, we investigate Ito’s formula and Bougerol’s identity building a strong theoretical foundation for our ˆ
subsequent analyses. The study then looks into the basic properties of Planar Brownian Motion, introducing the skew product representation, exit times, and Laplace transformations of
hitting times, while examining the significance of Williams’ ”pinching method” and Spitzer’s
theorem. In the realm of financial mathematics, we explore the implications of Windings of
Planar Brownian Motion, with a focus on Asian options and exponential functionals of Brownian motion, opening up new possibilities for financial modeling and risk assessment. Finally,
we validate our theoretical findings through simulations,where we calculate the price of Asian
call options for commodities and stocks, reinforcing the practical applicability of our research
in real-world scenarios. This comprehensive investigation contributes significantly to the understanding of stochastic analysis and its tangible benefits in financial decision-making.
